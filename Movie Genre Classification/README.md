# Movie Genre Classification

## Overview

This repository contains code for a movie genre classification project using machine learning. The goal is to predict the genre of movies based on their descriptions. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, text cleaning, and the training of a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes two files:

- `train_data.txt`: Contains the training data with columns 'Title', 'Genre', and 'Description'.
- `test_data.txt`: Contains the test data with columns 'Id', 'Title', and 'Description'.

## Google Colab Setup

1. Open the Movie_Genre_Classification.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to upload the required dataset files (`train_data.txt` and `test_data.txt`) to your Colab environment.

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code.


Happy coding!
